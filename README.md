# ImmoEliza Real Estate Analysis
Welcome to the Immo Eliza Real Estate Analysis project! In this project, we aim to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's real estate sales.
  
## Description
This project is a part of Becode.org AI Bootcamp course. Our task was to preprocess the data for machine learning, select appropriate features, and build regression models to predict property prices accurately.


## Installation
![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3x-blue) ![sklearn](https://img.shields.io/badge/sklearn-green) ![pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-purple) 

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:
* Clone the repository from [Here](https://github.com/moni2code/challenge-regression)
* Set up a Python environment with the necessary dependencies or install the required packages using ```pip install -m requirements.txt ```.
* Open the Jupyter Notebook that contains the model building code.
  
## Usage
The notebooks inside the model building directory contains the code for model building depending on what kind of model you want to use like linear models and non-linear models.
